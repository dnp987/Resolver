# Resolver
The assessment project code files are in a zip file, Resolver.zip, which can be unzipped in any folder. You can use VS Code or any other IDE tool to view and run the assessment code.

The assessment code is also available on GitHub, https://github.com/dnp987/Resolver, which is a publicly available.

Selenium and Python were used to for the code and the main function, main.py, calls tests 1-6. Each one addressed the corresponding test described in the guide. The code was written to be straightforward and easy to follow. Pytest or Unittest were not used because VS Code and Eclipse both require plug-ins which may not run in a corporate environment.

Note that main.py is where all the tests are run from. All 6 tests are called from main.py one by one.

Parametes for all tests are in the spreadsheet file "resolver.xlsx". The browser to be used for each test can be specified, as well as the test parameters.
